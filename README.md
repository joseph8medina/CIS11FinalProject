# CIS11FinalProject
Spring 2024 CIS-11 Final Project: Project B, 5 Test Scores - Average, Min, Max, Letter Grade

This application will work on creating a user input based program of five test scores. With these numbers, the tester is able to see the maximum, minimum, and average. After conducting these three routines, the user will display the given letter grade based on the inputted scores. After, the console should display these values ranging from F (0-50), D (60-69), C (70-79), B (80-89), A (90,100). 

This program implements branching, loops, subroutines, labels, and more to create a program which it receives 5 different inputs as test scores and deterines the average, max, min, and letter grades.
